# Godot 4 Color Correction and Screen Effects Visual Shaders

## Description

Color correcting shader graph (visual shader) for Godot 4.3 (may work with other versions too), will probably work with Redot Engine as well.

There are three branches: ColorCorrection Extra, ColorCorrection Mini, and Screen Effects Ultimate. The main shader for now is Extra. It can tweak saturation and brightness, tune color temperature for the overall image, tune it for bright and dark areas (in smaller scale), etc. It works similar to video editing software and is fully compatible with basic environment and camera features of Godot Engine. 

### ColorCorrection Mini
Tune color temperature, brightness, saturation, and green tint of the whole image. With this simple and fast shader you can easily make the game feel colder, warmer, or more dangerous (like on icy mountains, hot volcano, or poisoned swamps respectively).

### ColorCorrection Extra
Same as Mini, but has also features to tweak Bright and Dark areas separately, so the results are almost unlimited: you can turn day into night in a few clicks.

### Screen Effects Ultimate
Same as Extra, but with additional effects, like Sharpening and Blur, Vignette, and Chromatic Aberrations. Please, be very careful with Chromatic Aberrations â€” it's the easiest way to get motion sickness.
